title:  "Toward Trustworthy AI: Mechanisms for Supporting Verifiable Claims | The increasingly widespread application of AI research has brought growing awareness of the risks posed by AI systems, and recognition that existing regulations and norms in industry and academia are insufficient to ensure responsible AI development. In order for AI developers to earn trust from users, civil society, governments, and other stakeholders, there is a need to move beyond principles to a focus on mechanisms for demonstrating responsible behavior. Making and assessing verifiable claims, to which developers can be held accountable, is one step in this direction."
